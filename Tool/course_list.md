# Software Engineering Course List

## Computer Basic Course

1. Computer composition principle
   This course introduces the basic construction of computer composition. Including the following parts:
   + Hardware composition
   + How data is stored in the computer (Original code, Reverse code, Complement code)
   + Four operations in a computer (+, -, *, /)
   + Computer low-level instructions, and how to use it
   + Computer storage structure,

    The content of this course focuses on how the underlying computer is implemented.
2. **Computer network**
   Describes how to transfer data over the network.Computer network mainly explains the seven-layer structure(Open System Interconnection) in the network:
   + Application Layer
   + Presentation Layer
   + Session Layer
   + **Transport Layer** (include TCP/UDP protocol,Often used in network programming)
   + Network Layer
   + Data Link Layer
   + Physical Layer
3. Network Information Security
   Introduced some encryption algorithms, such as RSA.Explained the principle of public and private keys
4. Compilation principle
   This course is a more professional course on how computers analyze and execute code.

## Coding Course

1. C, C++, Python, Java
   Basically programming language courses are the same.The most important thing to learn coding is practice.[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a good platform.A little progress every day, you can become a master programmer.
2. Data Structures
   Introduced common data structures in programming:

   + Linear table
   + Linked list
   + Binary tree
   + Figure
   
   And sorting algorithm:(I implemented these sorting algorithms using python, https://github.com/drogonFan/Daily-learning/tree/master/%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95/python/Sort)
   + Selection Sort
   + Insertion Sort
   + Merge Sort
   + Bubble Sort
   + Quick Sort
   + Heap Sort
   + Shell Sort
   + Bucket Sort
   + Counting Sort
3. Database Principle
   It mainly describes how to use the database.A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.(This is copied from Wikipedia)

   The database I often use is:

   + Relational Database: MySql,Sqlserver
   + NoSql: redis,Mongodb
